# Clue / Information
Bank security personnel have intercepted a photograph taken with a thermal camera of a suspicious employee loitering near a safe. An investigation is underway to determine if this individual was able to obtain the code to the safe. Investigation of the safe's keypad reveals that it only accepts four-digit codes.

# Resolution
The image shows the keypad.
The '0' key is the less warm from the most warm, so it was the first used, then we have the '5' key, then the '7' and lastly the '3'.
