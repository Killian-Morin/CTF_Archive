# Mail me, pick me, choose me!!!!

## Clue / Information

Hi, I’m phineas! I used to love writing in my-diary, until Candace started snooping. So now, I write my-diary online. Pretty sure she can’t bust me here… haha!

## Resolution

After a quick search of `phineas online diary` we end up with: https://www.my-diary.org/read/d/1072443/phineas

On entry 3 he mentions `kumarsinghahmed`, again after an online search I found another diary: https://www.my-diary.org/read/e/546924142/kumarsinghahmed:-sad-again#blue where there is a flag: `BITSCTF{memories_are_fragile_little_things_fa16bd1}` but it didn't work for this challenge.

It mentions memory loses and from the title of the challenge a mail.
