# Clue / Information
While responding to a recent security incident, TGRI found the following image on an employee’s compromised machine. We need to confirm which DEADFACE actor attacked TGRI.

There’s probably one or more hints in the image that will point you in the right direction.

Submit the flag as flag{flag}.

# Resolution

Since in https://ghosttown.deadface.io/t/tgri-employee-workstation-compromised/40/5 `spookyboi` says that he is the one that attack I tried `flag{spookyboi}` but it wasn't that.
