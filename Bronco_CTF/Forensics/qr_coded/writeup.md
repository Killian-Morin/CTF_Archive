# QR Coded

## Clue / Information

This one should be really easy. All you have to do is scan a QR code!

## Resolution

Simply scanning this QR code as it appears gives `bracco{thi5_1sn7_r34l}`, obviously not the good one.

Tried some tools, `exiftool`, Wireshark

Found by [@Lord](https://github.com/trubat-d) using StegSolve

Flag is: bronco{th1s_0n3_i5}
