# Clue / Information
The team over at Turbo Tactical successfully got access to a discussion over on GhostTown between DEADFACE members mort1cia and gh0st404 looking to meetup in real life. It would be a big win for the team to be able to alert the local authorities, but they canâ€™t seem to identify the precise location given the file that was included in the thread. Can you harness all of your analytical techniques to identify the exact coordinates of the meeting?
