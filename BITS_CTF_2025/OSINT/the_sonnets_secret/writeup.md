## Resolution

Clue from the poem:
> Scotland's heart
> Find where the old and new entwine,
> Where modern glass meets ancient spine.
> The murder's stage, now tourist's fare,
> Reveals itself to those who dare.
> Seek ye the place where justice dwells,
> In chambers where the truth compels,
> A door of crimson, walls of white,
> Not far from where the monarch fell,
> A modern Portia casts his spell,
> Now seek the plate upon the door,
> What name is etched in letters clear?

Search a place in Scotland's heart -> building with modern glass and ancient spine -> a murder happened there -> justice palace / lawyer -> red door white wall -> link to a King / Monarchy / important event related to the place -> plate upon a door with a name `etched in letters clear`

Edinburgh is considered the heart of Scotland.

All leads sent me to Edinburgh, specifically near the Parliament House, the Grassmarket area and the Greyfriars Kirkyard.

I explored a bit the Greyfriars Kirkyard cemetry, looking for a tomb with a Henry and George near it.
