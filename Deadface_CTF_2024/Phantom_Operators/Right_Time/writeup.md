# Clue / Information
TGRI employee Garry Sartoris fell for a phishing attack recently. Itâ€™s hard to say what DEADFACE was after, but Turbo Tactical needs your help looking through the attack artifacts. Take a look at this memory dump and submit the system time on which the memory was captured.

Submit the flag as flag{YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss+00:00}.

# Resolution
Had to use `unzip phantom_memory.zip` since I ended up getting the `Error 79 - Inappropriate file type or format` when opening it via the finder. https://iboysoft.com/howto/fix-unable-to-expand-zip-mac.html



Information for github: I did not push the .raw file that is in `phantom_memory.zip` since it's 9.66GB and the `.zip` itself is already 2.29GB.
