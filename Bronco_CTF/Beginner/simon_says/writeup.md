## Resolution

Checked the metadata with [metadata2go](https://www.metadata2go.com/), nothing relevant came up.

Uploaded the image to [aperisolve](https://www.aperisolve.com/) since it's a tool recommanded by the CTF and I wanted to see what it can do.
In the view section, there is an image within the blue sub-section that has the flag: [image with flag](./image_b_3.png).

flag: `bronco{simon_says_submit_this_flag}`
